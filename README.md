# Macrovascular Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Prediction
Prior Knowledge-Aware Fusion Network for Prediction of Macrovascular Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma

We provide the our PKAFnet and the tumor margin extraction method. 

## Details
The illustration of the code is listed as following:

The folder "model" includes the architecture of PKAFnet.

The folder "DataUtils" provides the dataloading method of our proposed method, which including margin extraction and image loading.
